; ``````` GAME.INI TEMPLATE ```````
; ```````      README       ```````

; A Game.ini file must not exist yet for your server.
; This templated file will be loaded with data from ARK
; once your server does a world save. Any settings you set
; yourself and save won't be overridden by ARK once it saves
; your server world.

; Contains commonly tweaked settings to get you started.
; In order to use, just remove the leading semicolon (;)
; in front of whatever setting you want to tweak.
; Then change the number to whatever you want.
; Most are self explanatory, but you can find documentation here:
; https://ark.wiki.gg/wiki/Server_configuration
