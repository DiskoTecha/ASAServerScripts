Automating ARK: Survival Ascended Server Management with Scheduled Tasks

If you're running an ARK: Survival Ascended server, you know how important it is to keep it updated, send RCON commands, and ensure a smooth shutdown. Automating these tasks through scheduled tasks can save you time and make server maintenance a breeze.

1. Updating the Server:

One of the critical tasks is keeping your server updated with the latest patches and content. To automate this, you can create a scheduled task to run the "update-ark-ascended-server.ps1" script at a specific time, such as midnight. Here's how:

Open Task Scheduler on your Windows server.
Click "Create Basic Task" and follow the wizard.
Choose a name for the task, e.g., "ARK Server Update."
Set the trigger to "Daily" and choose the time (midnight).
Select "Start a Program" as the action.
Browse to the location of your PowerShell script (update-ark-ascended-server.ps1).
Complete the wizard, and the task will run your script automatically at the scheduled time.
2. Sending RCON Commands:

If you want to send RCON commands at specific intervals, for example, to announce a server restart, you can create another scheduled task. Here's how:

Create a new scheduled task as before, but this time choose a different name like "ARK RCON Announce."
Set the trigger according to your desired schedule (e.g., 15 minutes before the daily restart).
Choose "Start a Program" as the action.
Use PowerShell to execute the RCON command:
powershell
Copy code
$serverHost = "Enter Ark Server IP or DNS"
$port = "Enter RCON port"
$password = "Enter Ark Server Admin Password"
$rconCommand = "broadcast Server restart in 15 minutes. Prepare to log off."

$mcrconCommand = "D:\rcon\mcrcon\mcrcon.exe -H $serverHost -P $port -p $password $rconCommand"

Invoke-Expression -Command $mcrconCommand
This will send an RCON command 15 minutes before your daily server restart. You can create additional tasks for the 10, 5, and 1-minute warnings.

3. Graceful Shutdown:

To shut down your server gracefully, create one more scheduled task:

Name it "ARK Server Shutdown."
Set the trigger for the desired shutdown time (e.g., right at midnight).
Choose "Start a Program" as the action.
Run a command to send an RCON command for the shutdown:
powershell
Copy code
$serverHost = "Enter Ark Server IP or DNS"
$port = "Enter RCON port"
$password = "Enter Ark Server Admin Password"
$rconCommand = "broadcast Server is shutting down. Save your progress."

$mcrconCommand = "D:\rcon\mcrcon\mcrcon.exe -H $serverHost -P $port -p $password $rconCommand"

Invoke-Expression -Command $mcrconCommand
After sending the RCON command, you can add a delay to allow players to prepare, and then use another command to shut down the server. This ensures that your server is handled with care, and your players have time to save their progress.

By creating these scheduled tasks, you can automate essential server management processes and keep your ARK: Survival Ascended server running smoothly. It's a great way to ensure your server is always up-to-date, your players are informed, and your server shuts down gracefully when needed. Happy server management!
